# Blockchain
My take on learning blockchain concept, no idea what i'll do with it.

## What is done
- Created a blockchain that is valid and serialized
- Somewhat functional proof of work concept so creating block actually takes effort
- Adjusting complexity based on previous blocks
- Added ability to save something to mined blocks (messages in this case)
- Added miners which mine them on separated threads

## TODO
- Make them useful?
- Maybe graphical representation of current blockchain (that would be cool)


Based on materials/sources from Jetbrains (they are great)
