# Blockchain
My take on learning blockchain concept, no idea what i'll do with it.

## What is done
- Created a blocks model that are linked to each other
- Somewhat functional proof of work concept so creating block actually takes effort

## TODO
- Create workers that actually mine them
- Make them useful?
- Maybe graphical representation of current blockchain (that would be cool)


Based on materials/sources from Jetbrains (they are great)
